# On the use of a stochastic line-search method to solve binary classification problem
Exploration of a new second-order method for Machine Learning

This project has been done at ISAE-SUPAERO in Toulouse, France during my second year as an Engineer student, under the supervision of Youssef Diouane and Michel Sala√ºn, Professors in Mathematics there.
This paper aims at testing the new algorithm 'ALAS' proposed by E. Bergou, Y. Diouane, V. Kungurtsev and C. W. Royer in the article entitled "A Subsampling Line-Search Method with Second-Order Results", 2018.
